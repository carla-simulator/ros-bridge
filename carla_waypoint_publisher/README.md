# Carla Waypoint Publisher

Carla supports waypoint calculations.
The node `carla_waypoint_publisher` makes this feature available in the ROS context.

It uses the current pose of the ego vehicle with role-name "ego_vehicle" as starting point. If the
vehicle is respawned, the route is newly calculated.

## Startup

As the waypoint publisher requires some Carla PythonAPI functionality that is not part of the python egg-file, you
have to extend your PYTHONPATH.

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path-to-carla>/PythonAPI/carla-<carla_version_and_arch>.egg:<path-to-carla>/PythonAPI/carla/

To run it:

    roslaunch carla_waypoint_publisher carla_waypoint_publisher.launch

## Set a goal

The goal is either read from the ROS topic `/carla/<ROLE NAME>/goal`, if available, or a fixed spawnpoint is used.

The prefered way of setting a goal is to click '2D Nav Goal' in RVIZ.

## Published waypoints

The calculated route is published:
